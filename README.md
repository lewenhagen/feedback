## config.json  

?init or hard edit file to get mailadress and irc-nick  

## from_inspect.json  

Wanted from inspect-script.  

Somehow connect cleared exercises to python.json. (with "kmom" and "course")

Then get corresponding text from python.json to the "rättare". 

## info.json  

Helpful extra text and fillings. Perhaps randomize "intro"?  

Links go in the bottom (like allinreps signature)  

## python.json  

Course specific file. 

holds all kmoms and tips to "rättaren" as well as the pre-text to kmom. Can also hold "availableInfo" for extra tips to student.
